# StoicBot
AI chatbot that's tailored to respond with relatable stoic quotes depending on how you're feeling.

### Currently responds reliably to these feelings:

 - greetings
 - farewells
 - life/death/meaning
 - sadness/negativity/depression
 - time/procrastination/busyness
 - burden/stress/baggage
 - fear/anxiety/worry
 - control/fortune/anger


## Using the Code

As long as everything in the requirements is installed all you've got to do is run the chat.py program

### Requirements

download Python 3.8.9

install requirements.txt

### Modification

If you would like to modify the chatbot and setup a new model that can be done by editing the intents.json file and tailoring the setup.py file.

Once the configuration is to your liking run the setup.py program and it will update the model so that next time you run chat.py it works on the new model.
